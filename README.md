# docker_pti

FIB-UPC College project. 
Since the new version of BMX6, BMX7, has rolled out it's time to test whether the update was worth.
For such manners we've come up with a way to test different topologies of routers in a fast and easy way. 
Based on Docker we've build a custom image of OpenWRT with BMX7 installed and a set of scripts to spawn containers.

[DockerHub Repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/rabbyte/docker_pti/) You download the images into docker using `docker pull rabbyte/docker_pti`
Though there's no need because the script will do it by itself
